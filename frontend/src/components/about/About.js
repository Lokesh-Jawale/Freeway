            <p> At <a href="/">freeway.com</a> (nonprofit site), We connect people who want to contribute to the
                reduction of the waste and saving precious resources by
                giving away the stuff that you don't need anymore to needy people
                and getting stuff for free by browsing through the donated things.
                Please don't SPAM the site (with improper donation or messaging) in any way.
                Use freeway.com for everyone's benefit.
                Hope you have great experience using freeway.com.
            </p>
